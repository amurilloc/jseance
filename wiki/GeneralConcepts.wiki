 = Template Execution Model =

The engine reads and executes a jSeance template node by node. Each node represents an action on the current context such as loading an XML model, writing a text file, iterate trough a node list, etc.

The context stores information relevant to the current node and behaves like a stack, every time a new XML node begins execution, a context is created. This context is a copy of the parent context and changes to it can be inherited by child XML nodes when their own context is created.

 = Context Elements =

A context is composed of:
 * A set of named *models*, each model has a root node and a current node
 * A set of definitions, which are named variables that can be used to pass information to included templates or to explicitly name common-used values
 * A text sink, which is the destination of the text produced. This could be a text file or if not specified, the console (for command line execution).
